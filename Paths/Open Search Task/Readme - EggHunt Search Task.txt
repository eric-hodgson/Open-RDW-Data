This data contains 55 unique paths from participants who completed a search task in a relatively open virtual forest(referred to as an Egg Hunt, in reference to the common Easter Egg Hunts in the USA), and were either redirected with steer-to-center or allowed to walk normally. 
Participants were given the dual tasks of (a) finding and remembering the locations of a set of five landmarks in the forest (e.g., a lamp post), while also (b) gathering colored posts to collect as many points as possible before the allotted time expired. A set of 500 posts were scattered randomly in each trial amongst a similarly random array of trees, such that the participants’ paths
would be unpredictable and there were many viable areas to explore. They were free to travel in any direction and to choose which post to collect or which landmark to visit. This was intended to test RDW’s ability to react to unpredictable user motion and redirect each user back into the center of the tracking area. If a user approached a wall, they were manually reset by an experimenter and pointed towards open space (typically towards the center of the tracking space). Participants completed one trial in each of the steered and un-steered conditions, walking for approximately 4 minutes in each case. Data for the un-steered trials of 14 early users contained a distance scaling error that essentially functioned as a distance gain with no other redirection; these are separated into a different folder. There are 36 steer-to-center paths and 19 normal, un-steered paths that do not contain distance scaling.  

In total, there are more than 4.5 hours of total walking time.
