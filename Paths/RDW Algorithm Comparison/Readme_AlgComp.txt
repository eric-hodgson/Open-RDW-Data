This data set includes 98 paths drawn from a study comparing the relative performance of four different RDW algorithms: steer-to-center(24 paths), steer-to-orbit (25 paths), steer-to-multiple-waypoints (24 paths), and a variation of steer-to-multiple targets that included the center (24 paths). This study asked participants to search for and collect items in an open forest virtual environment.  Participants could wander freely for 4 minutes in each trial (one trial per redirection algorithm) to collect as many posts as possible before time expired.  Users were reset manually by the experimenter if they approached a wall, and were pointed towards open space (typically the center of the tracking area). 

The 98 paths from this experiment represent approximately 6.5 hrs of walking.
