This data set includes 93 paths drawn from a study that compared RDW algorithm performance in a virtual environment that constrained users to walk mainly in long straight paths connected at right angles. Specifically, participants in this study were situated in a virtual grocery store and given a shopping list of items to find and collect before finally returning to the check-out area. Two shopping trips were completed with different shopping lists. One trip for each user was redirected with steer-to-center (48 paths), and the other with a steer-to-orbit algorithm (45 paths). This presents a qualitively different pattern of navigation than an open-world search task.

Users were reset manually at tracking boundaries and pointed back towards open space (typically the center of the tracking area). A trial ended when the user had collected and returned to the checkout area with all items, or at the end of 6 minutes. In practice, though, all participants took the full time.  This yielded a total of approximately 9.25 hrs of total walking.
